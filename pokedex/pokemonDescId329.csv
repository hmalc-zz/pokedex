329,7,To make prey faint VIBRAVA generates ultrasonic waves by vigorously making its two wings vibrate.This Pokemon's ultrasonic waves are so powerful they can bring on headaches in people.
329,8,VIBRAVA's wings have not yet completed the process of growing. Rather than flying long distances they are more useful for generating ultrasonic waves by vibrating.
329,9,It looses ultrasonic waves by rubbing its wings together. Since a VIBRAVA's wings are still in the process of growing it can only fly short distances.
329,10,It generates ultrasonic waves by violently flapping its wings. After making its prey faint it melts the prey with acid.
