82,1,Formed by several MAGNEMITEs linked together. Theyfrequently appear when sunspots flare up.
82,2,Formed by several MAGNEMITEs linked together. Theyfrequently appear when sunspots flare up.
82,3,Generates strange radio signals. It raises the tem perature by 3.6F degrees within 3 300 feet.
82,4,Three MAGNEMITE are linked by a strong magneticforce. Earaches will occur if you get too close.
82,5,The MAGNEMITE are united by a mag netism so power ful it dries all moisture in its vicinities.
82,6,When many MAGNETON gather together theresulting magnetic storm disrupts radio waves.
82,7,MAGNETON emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to mechanical devices. As a result large cities soundsirens to warn citizens of large-scale outbreaks of this Pokemon.
82,8,MAGNETON emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to electronics and precision instruments. Because ofthis it is said that some towns warn people to keep this Pokemon inside a POK  e BALL.
82,9,It is actually three MAGNEMITE linked by magnetism. It generates powerful radio waves that raise temperatures by 3.6 degrees F within a 3 300-foot radius.
82,10,A linked cluster formed of several MAGNEMITE. It discharges powerful magnetic waves at high voltage.
82,11,Formed by several MAGNEMITE linked together. They frequently appear when sunspots flare up.
82,12,It is actually three MAGNEMITE linked by magnetism. A group can set off a magnetic storm.
82,13,It is actually three MAGNEMITE linked by magnetism. A group can set off a magnetic storm.
82,14,Many mysteriously appear when more sunspots dot the sun. They stop TV sets from displaying properly.
82,15,Three MAGNEMITE are linked by a strong magnetic force. Earaches will occur if you get too close.
82,16,The MAGNEMITE are united by a magnetism so powerful it dries all moisture in its vicinity.
82,17,Many mysteriously appear when more sunspots dot the sun. They stop TV sets from displaying properly.
82,18,Many mysteriously appear when more sunspots dot the sun. They stop TV sets from displaying properly.
82,21,The stronger electromagnetic waves from the three linked Magnemite are enough to dry out surrounding moisture.
82,22,The stronger electromagnetic waves from the three linked Magnemite are enough to dry out surrounding moisture.
82,23,A linked cluster formed of several Magnemite. It discharges powerful magnetic waves at high voltage.
82,24,Generates strange radio signals. It raises the temperature by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit within 3 300 feet.
82,25,Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to mechanical devices. As a result large cities sound sirens to warn citizens of large-scale outbreaks of this Pokemon.
82,26,Magneton emits a powerful magnetic force that is fatal to electronics and precision instruments. Because of this it is said that some towns warn people to keep this Pokemon inside a Pok  e Ball.
