51,1,A team of DIGLETT triplets. It triggers hugeearthquakes by burrowing 60 miles underground.
51,2,A team of DIGLETT triplets. It triggers hugeearthquakes by burrowing 60 miles underground.
51,3,A team of triplets that can burrow over 60 MPH.Due to this some people think it's an earthquake.
51,4,Its three heads bob separately up and down to loosenthe soil nearby making it easier for it to burrow.
51,5,Extremely power ful they can DIG through even thehardest ground to a depth of over 60 miles.
51,6,These DIGLETT triplets dig over 60 miles below sealevel. No one knows what it's like underground.
51,7,DUGTRIO are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result each triplet thinks exactly like theother two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
51,8,DUGTRIO are actually triplets that emerged from one body. As a result each triplet thinks exactly like theother two triplets. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly.
51,9,Because the triplets originally split from one body they think exactly alike. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly through the ground.
